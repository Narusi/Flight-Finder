# Flight-Finder

Imagine you plan to travel to a different country but want to find a flight that fits into your budget! Isn't it kind of annoying to keep visiting flight site's daily to know if you can find a fare that is light on your pocket? Well, this is an attempt to automate this process via Splinter (a wrapper around Selenium), Python and Slack - for sending you updates. 

The bot sends you an update every half an hour (can be adjusted) so that you never miss an opportunity to book a budget airline! ![Sample Slack Message](https://github.com/sachs7/Flight-Finder/blob/master/Slack_Message_Example.png?raw=true "Slack Message")
